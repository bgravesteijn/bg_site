Yesterday, Daphne Voormolen and I attended a meeting orginized by the main Dutch funding organizations [ZonMW](<https://www.zonmw.nl/nl/>) and the [NWO](<https://www.nwo.nl/>), called ["Evolution or Revolution"](https://www.zonmw.nl/nl/actueel/agenda/detail/item/evolutie-of-revolutie/). The aim of the meeting was to have an open discussion. One where we, as researchers, were asked what they, as funders, could do to help create financial incentives to improve the scientific community. Through panel discussions, break-out sessions, and interactive [menti-questions](https://menti.com), we discussed how the scientific community in 2030 will have to function. The quintessential question was whether the community would go for an evolution, or a revolution in the field.
