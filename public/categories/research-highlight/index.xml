      <description>This blogpost is the first in a series, called “Research Highlights”.

I have been thinking about this since only recently, and I would like to share some thoughts on why this feels like the appropriate thing to do.
Most of you probably know that one of the perks of being a PhD student, is to write and publish papers.</description>
