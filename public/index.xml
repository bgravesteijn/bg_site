      <description>Mentally, I started preparing for this business trip in Tokyo, Japan. After making my way over to the national art center, I was notified that one of the new exhibitions was “Vienna on her way to Modernism”. Through paintings, decorations, and fasion of the fin-de-siècle Viennese art scene, the transformation of Vienna on its way to the 20th century was meticulously displayed. From “just” a European city, to the capitol of the continent, through the development of intensive instrastructure, avant-garde architecture, and of course, the flourishing culture, centered around the Viennese bourgoisie.</description>

      <description>A recent post focused around the future of acknowledging and recognizing science. One of the main points was that researchers right now are mostly acknowledged on their scientific output, instead of also on their total work as academic. As an illustration, I want to present how the community right now in practice values me as a researcher, as well as how I want to be valued.
Current acknowledgmentResearchers right now are acknowledged based on their scientific output: publications.</description>
