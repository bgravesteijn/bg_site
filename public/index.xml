      <description>The first official post in the series of research highlight will be a paper that I recently published in the journal “Resuscitation”. The title of the study is “Cost-effectiveness of extracorporeal cardiopulmonary resuscitation after in-hospital cardiac arrest: A Markov decision model”, which is a lengthy, sophisticated, complex, and incomprehensible title, as research should be. Let’s break down what it is about, why we did this study, so we could have a chat about it some time.</description>

&amp;mdash; David Menon (@Menon_Cambridge) September 8, 2019  For the last month, I have been staying in Cambridge, as you perhaps have read before. However, last week was a little different. I have been flying quite a lot this year: Japan, Vienna, Cambridge, Milan… But my final trip of 2019 commenced last week: a conference in the former beer capitol of the world, Leuven.</description>

      <title>Research visit to Cambridge</title>

      <description>The last couple of weeks, I am working in Cambridge. I’m working here with Ari Ercole, and David Menon. Moving to a city where you don’t know anybody can be quite scary. Will you find enough distraction, or will I bore myself to death? Will I drown myself with work, just to keep myself busy? Or will I find a balance?
Deep learningMy main focus while I’m here is to develop a deep learning algorithm to predict how patients will be treated the next day, based on how they have been treated.</description>

      <description>“Retire me to my Milan, where every third thought shall be my grave.” William Shakespeare
Visiting Milan to write a paper at the Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico di Milano: sounds like the most inspiring place to write, right? I know a professor who likes to come here for a week to write books, or funding applications. But now it’s my turn to be inspired by the city of fashion, the most cultivated and wealthiest city of Italy: the country of love.</description>

      <title>Anaesthesia meets Vienna</title>

      <description>Mentally, I started preparing for this business trip in Tokyo, Japan. After making my way over to the national art center, I was notified that one of the new exhibitions was “Vienna on her way to Modernism”. Through paintings, decorations, and fasion of the fin-de-siècle Viennese art scene, the transformation of Vienna on its way to the 20th century was meticulously displayed. From “just” a European city, to the capitol of the continent, through the development of intensive instrastructure, avant-garde architecture, and of course, the flourishing culture, centered around the Viennese bourgoisie.</description>

      <title>Acknowledging and recognizing scientists</title>

      <description>A recent post focused around the future of acknowledging and recognizing science. One of the main points was that researchers right now are mostly acknowledged on their scientific output, instead of also on their total work as academic. As an illustration, I want to present how the community right now in practice values me as a researcher, as well as how I want to be valued.
Current acknowledgmentResearchers right now are acknowledged based on their scientific output: publications.</description>
